# Schoology API - PHP SDK

The Schoology SDK encompasses all necessary parts, including the initial SSO SAML login request, requesting an oAuth access token, and making calls to the Schoology API. It is by no means necessary to create an application. If you don't want to use one or are writing an application not in PHP, you can take a look at them as an example for the types of operations that you will need to do.

## Two-legged oauth
Every Schoology user can generate unique two-legged oauth keys:
1. Log into Schoology
2. Navigate to /api. 
3. Click "Request API Keys"
4. Consumer Key and Consumer Secret will be generated

###### Making two-legged API call with SDK
1. Create constants for your consumer key and consumer secret
2. When constructing the Class, the token_key & token_secret parameters should be blank and the two_legged parameter should be set to TRUE
```php
require_once('application/schoology_sdk/SchoologyApi.class.php');
$this->schoology = new SchoologyApi(SCHOOLOGY_CONSUMER_KEY, SCHOOLOGY_CONSUMER_SECRET, '', '','', TRUE); 
```

## Three-legged oauth
When using the API on behalf of a Schoology Application, you must use each applications' unique oauth credentials. To find the credentials after adding an app:
1. Navigate to /apps/publisher
2. For each app click on the "options" action link and oauth info to see the application's consumer key and consumer secret.

###### Making three-legged API call with SDK
When making three-legged API calls the authorization flow is more complex:
1. Using the application's consumer key and consumer secret a call will be made to /oauth/request_token to get request tokens. The URL for the request should be api.schoology.com/v1/oauth_request_token
2. Using the oauth_token from the request_token call in step1, redirect the user to schoology login page with return_url and oauth_token. The URL for the authorize request should be www.schoology.com/oauth/authorize
3. the user will see the schoology login page. after the username / password are authenticated, the user is redirected to app.schoology.com/oauth/authorize page
4. the user clicks either approve or deny to grant your application access. this will create the access token and redirect the user to your website
5. This access token can then be used to make the correct Authorization headers to make normal API calls. This access token should be stored in a database and used for future API calls
The PHP SDK will take care of this entire OAuth handshake for you

For more detailled information about Authorization be see http://developers.schoology.com/api-documentation/authentication

## Using the API
All calls to the API can be done using the api() function in SchoologyApi.class.php file
###### api() parameters
1. $url  - The API endpoint you are accessing (Ex: 'users/5' to get user with uid = 5)
2. $method - Defaults to GET 
3. $body - If doing a POST or PUT, a request body needs to be sent in
4. $extra_headers  - Any extra request Headers

###### Sample API Response
A response with a 20x response code means the request was successful:

Headers
```

    }
}
```

A response with a 40x response code means the request was unsuccessful.

###### Postman example

To verify your API keys work correctly, import the postman example and paste in your API keys. Make the request_token call first, followed by the authorize call with the return_url and oauth_token.
